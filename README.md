### Highlights
* Versatile open-source framework for cross-term-compensated gradient waveforms.
* Robust to cross-terms regardless of background gradient magnitude and direction.
* Framework is compatible with tensor-valued diffusion encoding.
* Demonstration of signal and parameter errors for non-comp./comp. waveforms.
